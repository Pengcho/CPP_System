# CPP_System
An CPP system for learning. readme file is showing what I have done.

## First version: using command interface and local file to build the project.
Ideas:
1. Choose games to play and leave the records of the players.
2. We need: sign in, sign up, choosing, quit.
3. sign up: create information for the user to sign in.
4. sign in: after this you can choose which game to play. and after game you can record your score if you are the top 10 players.
5.
